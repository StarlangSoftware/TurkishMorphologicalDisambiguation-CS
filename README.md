## Creating MorphologicalDisambiguator 

MorphologicalDisambiguator provides Turkish morphological disambiguation. There are possible disambiguation techniques. Depending on the technique used, disambiguator can be instantiated as follows:

* Using `RootFirstDisambiguation`, the one that chooses only the root amongst the given analyses

        MorphologicalDisambiguator morphologicalDisambiguator = new RootFirstDisambiguation();

* Using `LongestRootFirstDisambiguation`, the one that chooses the root that is the most frequently used amongst the given analyses

        MorphologicalDisambiguator morphologicalDisambiguator = new LongestRootFirstDisambiguation();

* Using `HmmDisambiguation`, the one that chooses using an Hmm-based algorithm
        
        MorphologicalDisambiguator morphologicalDisambiguator = new HmmDisambiguation();

* Using `DummyDisambiguation`, the one that chooses a random one amongst the given analyses 
     
        MorphologicalDisambiguator morphologicalDisambiguator = new DummyDisambiguation();
    

## Training MorphologicalDisambiguator

To train the disambiguator, an instance of `DisambiguationCorpus` object is needed. This can be instantiated and the disambiguator can be trained and saved as follows:

    DisambiguationCorpus corpus = new DisambiguationCorpus("penn_treebank.txt");
    morphologicalDisambiguator.Train(corpus);
    morphologicalDisambiguator.SaveModel();
    
      
## Sentence Disambiguation

To disambiguate a sentence, a `FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer` instance is required. This can be created as below, further information can be found [here](https://github.com/olcaytaner/MorphologicalAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#creating-fsmmorphologicalanalyzer).

    FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer fsm = new FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer();
    
A sentence can be disambiguated as follows: 
    
    Sentence sentence = new Sentence("Yar覺n doktora gidecekler");
    FsmParseList[] fsmParseList = fsm.RobustMorphologicalAnalysis(sentence);
    Console.WriteLine("All parses");
    Console.WriteLine("--------------------------");
    for(int i = 0; i < fsmParseList.Length; i++){
        Console.WriteLine(fsmParseList[i]);
    }
    List<FsmParse> candidateParses = morphologicalDisambiguator.Disambiguate(fsmParseList);
    Console.WriteLine("Parses after disambiguation");
    Console.WriteLine("--------------------------");
    for(int i = 0; i < candidateParses.Size(); i++){
        Console.WriteLine(candidateParses[i]);
    }

Output

    
    All parses
